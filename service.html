                        <p>
                            Each person brings to work a unique set of skills, knowledge and beliefs. Each person behaves in a way that they feel is successful. The communication challenges in most work environments relate to the establishment and maintenance of trust.
                            <br><br>
                            Effective interpersonal communication is critical in establishing a motivational work environment that maximises productivity. This workshop looks at behaviour as a choice and increases awareness of the consequences behavioural choices have on others. Participants learn that through adaptive behaviour, they can choose communication strategies that establish trust, minimise conflict, maximise cooperation and create a positive work environment that increases productivity and enhances job satisfaction.

                        <p>
                            Finding the right candidate for a job is a challenging process. The interview process involves more than just finding candidates to interview.
                            <br><br>
                            Interviewing is an area where interviewers can unknowingly tread dangerously and get themselves and their companies into hot water with inappropriate questions. Even if the questions asked are legal, they must be the right job-related questions to accurately and correctly assess the candidate.
                            <br><br>
                            This workshop looks at the interviewing process from beginning to end. Participants learn to assess the job and determine the skills required to do the job. Then they learn to formulate the best questions and create a rating process to correctly assess the candidates' qualifications

                            Most companies have focused their attention on the business process while ignoring projects. This can be a costly mistake as everything new and improved occurs as a result of a project. All growth in the business will occur through the successful completion of projects. Projects that are incomplete, late, over-budget or off target may impede your ability to meet your strategic business goals. In today's world, the ability to manage projects effectively translates into a comprehensive advantage.

                        <p>
                            Since most employees are products of a passive educational system, they do not know how to be proactive in identifying their training needs nor designing and evaluating their own learning. This workshop fosters the self-directive perspective while building active learning skills. All this is done from a career development perspective to enable employees to refine their knowledge and skills in areas where it is not feasible for their employer to provide a training program relevant to their needs.

                        <h3>Overview</h3>
                        <p>
                            Since most employees are products of a passive educational system, they do not know how to be proactive in identifying their training needs nor designing and evaluating their own learning. This workshop fosters the self-directive perspective while building active learning skills. All this is done from a career development perspective to enable employees to refine their knowledge and skills in areas where it is not feasible for their employer to provide a training program relevant to their needs.
                        </p>
